Following adoption at the Council meeting on 8 November 2012 the development plan for the borough comprises: 1. The \"Hillingdon Local Plan: Part One\" - Strategic Policies 2. The extant 2007 Saved Unitary Development Plan policies adopted as the - \"Hillingdon Local Plan: Part Two\", pending the preparation and adoption of subsequent site specific allocations, development management policies and a policies map; and 3. The London Plan published by the Mayor of London in July 2011. Further details can be found on the Council's website: www.hillingdon.gov.uk Policies applying to property: Air Quality Management Area Local Distributor Roads-Fairfield Road The Council published the Proposed Submission version of its Local Plan Part 2 for public comment on 22nd September 2014. This comprises: The Development Management Policies document Site Allocations and Designations Policies Map presented as a booklet called \"Atlas of Changes\" showing proposed changes to the Saved UDP Proposals Map. For further details, please visit www.hillingdon.gov.uk/localplan. Changes to Policies under the Proposed Submission: Delete Local Distributor Roads New Archaeological Priority Zone - Colne Valley 2.1.

No.  Search Ref : 2789/20   Page 5 of 9\nDrainage Matters 3.3.   (a) Is the property served by a sustainable urban drainage system (SuDS)? All properties are served by sustainable drainage systems. Sustainable drainage refers to a variety of drainage methods, from the traditional pipe solutions to swales, rain gardens and soakaways. There is information on the Council¿s website about Sustainable drainage: http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/article/12578/Sustainable-drainage- requirements-for-planning-applications Schedule 3 of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 has not been enacted. Instead the government brought in changes to the planning system which required sustainable drainage to be a material planning consideration for major applications. As there is no requirement for the Council to adopt these systems yet, there is no legal requirement to record details of property related SuDS. (b) Are there SuDS features within the boundary of the property? If yes, is the owner responsible for maintenance? All properties are served by sustainable drainage systems. The Council has not adopted any such features to date, therefore the responsibility will lie with others such as the landowner or utility company. It is recommended that prospective purchasers check planning approvals and Section 106 Agreements for their property, and establish with the vendors whether any sustainable urban drainage systems exist. Information relating to property SuDS may have been submitted with the relevant planning application, or with the discharge of planning conditions. Planning applications can be viewed on the Council¿s website: http://planning.hillingdon.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningSearch For newly built property, information should be sought from the developer, including clarification of any maintenance responsibilities a property owner may inherit or any maintenance agreements they may be required to fund, should any exist through a management company. Water and Sewerage Companies will normally include a surface water charge in their bills, where roof water from a property connects to a public surface water sewer. Drainage infrastructure serving a single property, and within the curtilage of that property, will be the responsibility of the homeowner to maintain, unless directed otherwise. (c) If the property benefits from a SuDS for which there is a charge, who bills the property for the surface water drainage charge? Please see above answer. Water and Sewerage Companies will normally include a surface water charge in their bills where roof water from a property connects to a public surface water sewer. Nearby Road Schemes 3.4.

There is information on the Council¿s website about Sustainable drainage: http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/article/12578/Sustainable-drainage- requirements-for-planning-applications Schedule 3 of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 has not been enacted. Instead the government brought in changes to the planning system which required sustainable drainage to be a material planning consideration for major applications. As there is no requirement for the Council to adopt these systems yet, there is no legal requirement to record details of property related SuDS. (b) Are there SuDS features within the boundary of the property? If yes, is the owner responsible for maintenance? All properties are served by sustainable drainage systems.",

The Council has not adopted any such features to date, therefore the responsibility will lie with others such as the landowner or utility company.

Information relating to property SuDS may have been submitted with the relevant planning application, or with the discharge of planning conditions. Planning applications can be viewed on the Council¿s website: http://planning.hillingdon.gov.uk/OcellaWeb/planningSearch For newly built property, information should be sought from the developer, including clarification of any maintenance responsibilities a property owner may inherit or any maintenance agreements they may be required to fund, should any exist through a management company.",
